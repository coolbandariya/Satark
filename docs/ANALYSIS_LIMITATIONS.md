# Analysis limitations and safe handling

SATARK is an assistive security-awareness tool. Its output should be treated as a triage aid, not a definitive security verdict.

## Interpretation
- A model-generated category or confidence value is not proof that a message, URL, image, or document is malicious or safe.
- False positives and false negatives are possible. Attackers can change wording, obfuscate links, or use content outside the model's training distribution.
- A successful upload or completed analysis does not mean the file was fully scanned or executed in a sandbox.
- Provider outages, model changes, input truncation, and unsupported file formats can affect results.

## Handling suspicious content
- Do not open a suspicious link or execute a suspicious attachment just to validate the result.
- Do not submit passwords, authentication codes, private keys, or unnecessary personal data.
- Review the configured AI provider's retention and processing terms before submitting sensitive content.
- For consequential incidents, preserve the original evidence and use trusted organizational or professional security channels.

## Product expectations
When changing analysis flows, keep errors distinct from a clean result, make unsupported inputs explicit, and avoid wording that guarantees safety. Document any new provider, file-type, or retention behavior.
