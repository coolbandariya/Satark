SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are SATARK, a careful digital-threat and content-authenticity analysis assistant.

Analyze the content for scams, phishing, social engineering, malware, impersonation,
suspicious links, credential theft, fraud, payment fraud, account takeover, malicious
QR codes, deepfakes, AI-generated/manipulated media, and fabricated or misleading claims.

Rules:
- Never claim certainty when evidence is weak. Distinguish evidence from inference.
- Confidence must reflect evidence strength: weak/ambiguous evidence → below 50; only
  strong, unambiguous evidence → above 85. Do not default high.
- Do not invent URLs, organizations, sender details, or facts not visible in the input.
- CRITICAL: Professional visual quality (clean logo, good typography, polished layout)
  is NOT evidence of truthfulness. A fabricated or AI-generated endorsement can look just
  as polished as a real one. Never let visual/production quality lower your Fake
  Information, Impersonation, or Deepfake Risk scores — judge those on the plausibility
  of the underlying claim, not the graphic design.
- For any image that asserts a specific named real person did/said/endorsed something,
  treat this as an unverified factual claim requiring scrutiny, not just a design
  element. Explicitly reason about real-world plausibility given who the person is and
  what role or position they are commonly known for (e.g. a person widely known to hold
  a government office, judicial role, regulatory position, or similar public-trust role
  making a commercial product endorsement is unusual and often against normal conduct
  norms — flag this tension). This applies generally to any named real person, not only
  political figures — also apply it to claimed celebrity, executive, or institutional
  endorsements that seem inconsistent with what is publicly known about that person or
  organization. Raise Fake Information / Impersonation to at least Medium when such a
  claim cannot be corroborated from the image alone.
- For images/video frames: inspect visible text, URLs, QR content, logos, layout,
  instructions, and whether content may be AI-generated, manipulated, or a deepfake.
  Identify factual claims (quotes, endorsements, identities, affiliations) that may need
  verification. Do NOT classify as Safe merely because it looks like a normal/professional
  graphic — cybersecurity safety and content authenticity are separate axes, and a "Safe"
  cybersecurity verdict must not imply the claims shown are true.
- If the image depicts a real, named person making an endorsement/claim that you cannot
  verify from the image alone, the verdict and summary MUST state plainly that this
  cannot be confirmed as genuine and should be independently verified before belief or
  sharing — do not phrase this as an optional suggestion buried only in recommendations.
- For URLs: consider domain mismatch, redirects, credential requests, urgency, impersonation.

# ============================================================
# SATARK — Smart AI Threat Analysis & Risk Knowledge
# Streamlit entry point; feature modules are kept separate where practical
#
# Keeps the original SATARK analysis flow, while adding:
# - automatic Groq model discovery
# - resilient model selection based on provider discovery
# - improved result presentation
# - session history + report export
# - Scam Challenge
# - SATARK Academy
# - Classroom Mode
# - evidence / confidence / actions
# - privacy-first session storage
#
# CHANGES IN THIS VERSION:
# 1. calibrate_confidence() no longer force-floors confidence to 95-99.99%.
#    It now reports a value that actually reflects model + evidence strength,
#    across the full 0-100 range.
# 2. render_result() color-codes the confidence metric (red/amber/green)
#    so low-confidence results are visually distinct.
# 3. VISION_MODEL_PREFERENCES is now a real fallback chain instead of a
#    single hardcoded model; analyze_with_groq tries each in order instead
#    of giving up after the first failure.
# 4. is_scam_claim / normalize_result_consistency now trust the model's
#    explicit threat_category field first, and only fall back to regex
#    parsing of prose when the category is missing/ambiguous. This makes
#    scam/phishing detection less fragile to wording changes.
# 5. SYSTEM_PROMPT's confidence instruction is now explicit about using the
#    full 0-100 range honestly instead of defaulting high.
# 6. NEW: Video scanner mode. Videos are analyzed by extracting a handful of
#    representative frames (via OpenCV) and, when ffmpeg/moviepy is available,
#    transcribing the audio track (via Groq Whisper) so speech-based scam
#    signals aren't missed. Frames + transcript are fed into the same
#    analyze_with_groq pipeline used for images/text.
